Import sequences.csv file:

```{r}
Sequences <- read.csv("Sequences.csv")
```


Find the numbers of each base (A, C, T, G) in each of the three sequences. Print out the number of each nucleotide as a table for each of the three sequences.

```{r}
seqCount <- data.frame(Sequence = c(">HQ433694.1", ">HQ433691.1", ">HQ433692.1"), #create column for sequence names 
                       A = str_count(Sequences$Sequence, "A"), #find occurrences of A
                       T = str_count(Sequences$Sequence, "T"), #find occurrences of T
                       C = str_count(Sequences$Sequence, "C"), #find occurrences of C
                       G = str_count(Sequences$Sequence, "G")) #find occurrences of G

print(seqCount) #print table of counts of bases for each sequence
```

Print out each sequence:

```{r}
print(Sequences$Sequence)
```

Include an image of a bacteria from the internet, and a link to the Wikipedia page about *Borrelia burgdorferi*.  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
url <- "https://res.cloudinary.com/broadcastmed/image/fetch/q_auto,c_fit,w_1300,h_1300,f_auto/http%3A%2F%2F55933-bcmed.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbcp%2Fimages%2FdmImage%2FSourceImage%2Frheumatology_oct_eblast2.jpg"

Calculate GC% content.

```{r}
seqCount<- seqCount %>% #manipulate data as same object
  group_by(Sequence) %>% #manipulate according to sequence
  mutate(gc_content = (G+C)/(A+T+G+C)) #divide total number of G+C by all bases to obtain %GC

seqCount$gc_content #see GC% content for each 
```
